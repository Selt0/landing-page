Created a website using this [template](https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-landing-page/) as inspiration. 

I was more cautious about the type of CSS selectors I used. In my previous project, I went a little crazy with using very specific selectors such as `header nav ul li a`. 

In this project I opted to keep selectors as short as possible, optimizing the use of classes. 

I learned a new trick. If you hover over the row, which includes 'Community', 'Legend', and 'Benefits you'll notice it increases in size. At first, I had trouble increasing the size without moving elements around it. By wrapping the icon in a div and setting a height on the wrapper the icon can increase in size without moving the elements around it.
